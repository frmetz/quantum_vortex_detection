# Deep learning based quantum vortex detection in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates

This repository contains the models and code used for the paper [Deep-learning-based quantum vortex detection in atomic Boseâ€“Einstein condensates](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abea6a).

The code is provided in the form of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) using the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/) and the machine learning library [Flux](https://fluxml.ai/Flux.jl/stable/). The notebooks require [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl).

### Content
* *vortex_detection.ipynb* - jupyter notebook used for training and evaluating the ML based vortex detector
* *vortex_detection_classification.ipynb* - slightly modified version where the circulation direction of a vortex is also classified
* *utils.jl*               - additional functions used in the notebooks
* *example_data/*          - example images to run the notebook
* *models/*                - pretrained models discussed in the paper
